# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** I already knew the content in this section but my objective is to go through everything, leaving no stone unturned. I expect as time progresses and I get into the groove I'll be able to churn out more in less time.

### Day 2: November 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** There were a few things I hadn't used before but had some familiarity with from before. I did my hour today, but didn't complete all the lesson until the early hours of Day 3. I'm looking forward to learning animations and enhancing my design skills. I need to manage distractions better, but overall I'm happy with my progress.
