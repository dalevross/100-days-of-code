# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** I already knew the content in this section but my objective is to go through everything, leaving no stone unturned. I expect as time progresses and I get into the groove I'll be able to churn out more in less time.

### Day 2: November 7, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic CSS section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** There were a few things I hadn't used before but had some familiarity with from before. I did my hour today, but didn't complete all the lesson until the early hours of Day 3. I'm looking forward to learning animations and enhancing my design skills. I need to manage distractions better, but overall I'm happy with my progress.

### Day 3: November 8, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Actually completed the Basic CSS section and made significant progress in the Applied Visual Design section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** I've been putting in most of my work in the 10pm to 3-4am timeframe EST. This means my hour a day tends to merge across days. I hadn't completed the Basic CSS track but wrapped it up early the next morning. I've been distracted or redirecting energy to other activities besides freecodecamp but am definitely using the time more productively than my null days so that's not entirely negative.

### Day 4: November 9, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Did some work on my personal project that I developed a few years ago.

**Thoughts** Focus was shifted from freecodecamp again to work on fixing my Chrome Extension to add it to my portfolio. This also involved migrating the FAQ from an old Azure Dev Ops company repository to my personal github pages live site. While this wasn't learning directly I enjoyed getting back into the swing of thing and learning about what had changed with the tooling and environments since I've been out. No serious roadblocks yet so I'm thankful.

### Day 5: November 10, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continued working with my chrome extension and checked out Serverless.

**Thoughts** I've set out to cover content that I may have overlooked while I was previously in the field, and even the basic things I already know. I can't help the burning desire to try to build something of value right way. I have a few ideas I want to implement as twitter bots so I decided to sign up for serverless which involved resolving a few issues with my AWS credentials and setting up users. I downloaded an example project and was able to get it configured, however, I ran into issues when testing that I've yet to resolve. I'd like to fully return to free code camp but a few slow days there with focus redirected doesn't hurt. It was encouraging to see that I could understand the flow of the sample code and the project setup wasn't too complex.

### Day 6: November 11, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Set up Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux and installed PHP and Composer.

**Thoughts** Another day of setting up my environment with my toolchain. Minimal progress on freecodecamp.org again. I did meet my objectives with getting PHP and Composer installed and was able to set up a test PHP project with a few dependencies. I started looking again at what it would take to complete a Microsoft certification today as I suspect after completing this learning track, my best chance is returning to the same stack I've had most comfort with throughout my career. I also started blogging again which involved a small bit of html/xml modification.

I used the following example for setting up the environment
