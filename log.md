# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: November 6, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section in the Responsive Web Design Certification

**Thoughts** I already knew the content in this section but my objective is to go through everything, leaving no stone unturned. I expect as time progresses and I get into the groove I'll be able to churn out more in less time.
